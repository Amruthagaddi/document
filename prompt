Build a full-stack Lost & Found website using React.js (frontend) and Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend) with user registration, 
login via phone & password (JWT authentication), and CRUD operations for lost/found items (with photo, category, location). Use Tailwind CSS 
for UI, Google Maps API for location, and protect APIs so only logged-in users can post or view items.

The idea is to build a system â€” web, app, or both â€” where people can report, track, and recover lost items.
ðŸ”¹ Items can be identified using unique IDs (like QR codes, serial numbers) or location tagging (GPS, maps).
ðŸ”¹ Users should be able to either list something they found or search for something they lost.
ðŸ”¹ Think creative: you can add features like photo uploads, real-time updates, or notifications when an item is found nearby.
